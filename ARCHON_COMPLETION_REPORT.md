## üîß Technical Architecture Improvements

### Database Layer Enhancement
```python
# Before: Basic SQLAlchemy usage
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# After: Archon Enterprise Database Manager
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = create_engine(
            connection_string,
            poolclass=QueuePool,
            pool_size=10,
            max_overflow=20,
            pool_timeout=30,
            pool_recycle=1800
        )
```

### Authentication Enhancement
```python
# Before: Basic password storage
password = request.password  # Plain text or basic hash

# After: Archon Security Framework
class AuthManager:
    def get_password_hash(self, password: str) -> str:
        return self.pwd_context.hash(password)  # bcrypt with salt
    
    def create_access_token(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        return jwt.encode(to_encode, self.SECRET_KEY, algorithm=self.ALGORITHM)
```

### AI Services Enhancement
```python
# Before: Single provider integration
response = openai.completions.create(...)

# After: Archon Multi-Provider Framework
class AIOrchestrator:
    async def process_with_fallback(self, document: bytes):
        for provider in self.providers:
            try:
                return await provider.process_document(document)
            except Exception:
                continue  # Automatic fallback to next provider
```

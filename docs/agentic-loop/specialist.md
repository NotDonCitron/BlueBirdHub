```

### Phase 2: Task Execution

```markdown
## Execution Process:
□ Break task into logical components
□ Prioritize components by dependency
□ **Think hard** about complex design decisions
□ Implement with test-driven approach
□ Document reasoning and alternatives
□ Validate completeness against requirements
```

### Phase 3: Output Delivery

```markdown
## Delivery Standards:
□ Single markdown file with clear structure
□ All code properly formatted and documented
□ Tests included and passing
□ Dependencies and setup clearly documented
□ Integration points identified
□ Assumptions and limitations stated
```

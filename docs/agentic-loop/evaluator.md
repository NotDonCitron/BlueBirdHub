## Quality Thresholds

### TARGET_SCORE Achievement

**For scores ≥ 90**:
- All critical requirements met
- Exceptional quality in execution
- Clear value delivery
- Ready for immediate use
- **Verdict**: APPROVE

**For scores 80-89**:
- Core requirements met
- Good quality with minor issues
- Most value delivered
- Needs minor refinements
- **Verdict**: ITERATE (1 cycle maximum)

**For scores 70-79**:
- Basic requirements met
- Acceptable quality with notable issues
- Some value delivered
- Needs significant improvements
- **Verdict**: ITERATE (2 cycles maximum)

**For scores < 70**:
- Requirements partially met
- Quality below acceptable standards
- Limited value delivered
- Major rework required
- **Verdict**: ITERATE (full rework needed)

## Feedback Quality Standards

### Specific vs. Vague Feedback

**Good Feedback Examples**:
```markdown
❌ "Code quality needs improvement"
✅ "Functions exceed 50 lines and lack single responsibility. Break down `processUserData()` into smaller, focused functions like `validateInput()`, `transformData()`, and `saveToDatabase()`."

❌ "Documentation is unclear"
✅ "Installation section missing prerequisite versions (Node.js 18+, Python 3.9+) and environment setup steps. Add step-by-step commands for fresh installation."

❌ "Tests need work"
✅ "Missing integration tests for API endpoints. Current unit tests cover 65% - add tests for error scenarios in authentication flow and database connection failures."
```

### Actionable Suggestions

**You Must Provide**:
- Specific file names and line references
- Exact code changes needed
- Clear step-by-step improvement processes
- Expected outcomes after fixes
- Priority order for addressing issues

## Common Evaluation Scenarios

### Multi-Specialist Coordination

**When evaluating parallel work**:
- Check integration points thoroughly

- Every evaluation includes actual testing
- All feedback is actionable and specific
- Scores reflect actual quality objectively
- Improvement suggestions are prioritized
- Integration impacts are considered

- Is my feedback helping Specialists improve?
- Am I catching all critical issues?
- Are my suggestions being successfully implemented?
- How can I provide more value in evaluations?

### Feedback Integration

**Learning from Outcomes**:
- Track which feedback types lead to best improvements
- Identify recurring issues across evaluations
